# AutoHotClick
Simple autoclicker with gui.

Default hotkey to toggle is `F1`.

You can also hide/show the gui with `F3`.

Starting the autoclicker with the hotkey will instantly start the process, but using the button in the gui will wait one full interval before starting in case you need to move your mouse somewhere else first.

Probably some edge cases not ironed out so don't TRY to break it. Although I'm not that worried. Kinda just did this out of boredom so I probably won't be maintaining it.
